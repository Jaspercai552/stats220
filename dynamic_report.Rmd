## Analysis of Platform and Content Viewing Habits
This study examines how viewers watch videos by looking at:
-Time spent on different content kinds.
-Total and average watched time on different platforms.
-Maximum, minimum, and average watched time.
The purpose is to give insights into the user's viewing habits using summary statistics and bar charts.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QiuHfekjrnlS0qQGK1x9eK89gwR_rvdpE-x3bVxPLBM/export?format=csv")

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(
    watched_time = `Approximately how many hours did you spend watching videos on YouTube or TikTok today?`,
    content = `What was the main type of content you watched today?`,
    platform_used = `Which platform did you mainly use for watching videos today?`
  )
total_time_summary <- latest_data %>%
  group_by(platform_used) %>%
  summarise(
    total_time = sum(watched_time, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Calculate summary values
max_time <- max(latest_data$watched_time, na.rm = TRUE)

print(paste("Maximum watched time recorded is:", max_time, "hours"))
print(paste("Minimum watched time recorded is:", min_time, "hours"))
print(paste("Average watched time is:", round(mean_time, 2), "hours"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

You need to change the contents of this Rmd! Replace the R code and markdown give below in this template document.

```{r}
pets <- c("cat", "dog", "turtle", "rabbit")
best_pet <- pets[1]

```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
