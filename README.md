# stats220

## Introduce to this repo
This is my repo for *STATS 220*. I try to make this as my first project online to show what I can do.

### First mission
The first mission is to make a meme by R and show it with a markdown file on [Github](https://github.com/Jaspercai552/stats220/edit/main/README.md)

#### A little about me

- I am undertaking a degree in Data Sciecnce & Mathematics
- I am taking *STATS 220* because it is required course and I like Stats
- I am interested in learning about learning more about stats knowledge![](https://media.tenor.com/wxJBXIvxJtwAAAAj/tkthao219-bubududu.gif)

##### My goals for STATS 220

1. Gain a better understanding of the content taught in *STATS 220*  
2. Become more confident in using **Markdown and RStudio**  
3. Understand how to create and share memes with R  

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
